EXAMPLE Programs for CFD2LCS:
#############################

To build:  
Use the supplied makefile

Usage:
mpirun -np $NPROCS ./EXECUTABLE_NAME $NPROC_X $NPROC_Y $NPROC Z
Each program expects 3 arguments corresponding to the number
of processors to be used  when decomposing the domain in the 
X Y and Z directions.

Example:
To run the double gyre fortran test on 8 cores, and using
an array of 4, 2, and 1 processors in the X Y and Z directions,

mpirun -np 8 ./DOUBLE_GYRE_F90 4 2 1


NOTES:
1. If you run 2 different programs, be sure to remove the cfd2lcs_tmp directory before execution. 
This can be done with:

make dataclean

2. If you want to run the examples on ARCHER, they should be first copied to your $WORK
directory before they are run.
