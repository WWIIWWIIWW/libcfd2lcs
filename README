CFD2LCS Version 1.0
##########
Prerequisites:
##########
1.  HDF5
2.  lapack
3.  An MPI fortran compiler

##########
To Build:
##########

make clean
make $YOUR_PLATFORM

where $YOUR_PLATFORM is the name of your system. The directory makefiles/ contains
several platform dependent Makefile.in scripts which define the various
cfd2lcs prerequisites.

To compile on a new system, called $YOUR_PLATFORM, you can do the following:

1. Copy one of the scripts in makefiles/ to a NEW FILE, makefiles/Makefile.$YOUR_PLATFORM.in

2. Edit the variables in makefiles/Makefile.$YOUR_PLATFORM.in

3. Add the following lines to the top level Makefile in this directory:

$YOUR_PLATFORM:
	ln -fs makefiles/Makefile.$YOUR_PLATFORM.in Makefile.in
	(cd src ; make)

4. Once you are sure the code compiles and runs correctly, send me your Makefile.in
 	so I can include it in the next release at J.Finn@liv.ac.uk

#########
TESTING
#########
In the examples directory, there are some (currently one) tests for the cfd2lcs library
these contain their own README files, describing how the library can be used.  Please
try them out on your own systems, and see if you can break them!

NB:  If you want to run these tests on ARCHER, they should be first copied to your $WORK
directory before they are run.
