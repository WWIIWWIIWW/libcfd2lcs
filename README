CFD2LCS Version 1.0
##########
Prerequisites:
##########
1.  HDF5 
2.  lapack
3.  An MPI fortran & C compiler

##########
In this directory:
##########
/doc :  Some basic documentation (work in progress)
/examples :  Some example programs using libcfd2lcs written in F90 and C  
/include : The default include directory for header/module files
/lib :  The default library directory for linking to libcfd2lcs with your program
Makefile : Default Makefile for libcfd2lcs and 
/makefiles : Several Makefile.in files for platform dependent compilation
/src :  The libcfd2lcs source code


##########
To Build:
##########

make $YOUR_PLATFORM
make EXAMPLES
make DOC

where $YOUR_PLATFORM is the name of your system. The directory makefiles/ contains
several platform dependent Makefile.in scripts which define the various
cfd2lcs prerequisites.

To compile on a new system, called $YOUR_PLATFORM, you can do the following:

1. Copy one of the scripts in makefiles/ to a NEW FILE, makefiles/Makefile.$YOUR_PLATFORM.in

2. Edit the variables in makefiles/Makefile.$YOUR_PLATFORM.in

3. Add the following lines to the top level Makefile in this directory:

$YOUR_PLATFORM:
	ln -fs makefiles/Makefile.$YOUR_PLATFORM.in Makefile.in
	(cd src ; make)

4. Once you are sure the code compiles and runs correctly, send me your Makefile.in
 	so I can include it in the next release at J.Finn@liv.ac.uk
