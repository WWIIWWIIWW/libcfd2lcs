##########
Prerequisites:
##########
1.  HDF5 (Optional) 
2.  liblapack
3.  An MPI fortran & C compiler

##########
In this directory:
##########
/doc :  Some basic documentation (work in progress)
/examples :  Some example programs using libcfd2lcs written in F90 and C  
/include : The default include directory for header/module files
/lib :  The default library directory for linking to libcfd2lcs with your program
Makefile : Default Makefile for libcfd2lcs and 
/makefiles : Several Makefile.in files for platform dependent compilation
/src :  The libcfd2lcs source code


##########
To Build:
##########
A. Sample usage of this makefile:                                           
>>    make PLATFORM             [Builds library for machine called PLATFORM]
>>    make EXAMPLES             [Builds example programs]                   
>>    make DOC                  [Builds documentation, requires pdflatex]   

B. To build libcfd2lcs on a currently supported platform:                   
>>    make AWESOMO4000          [UoL workstation]                           
>>    make AWESOMO4000-PROFILE  [UoL workstation with Scalasca profiler]    
>>    make LAPPY386             [Linux Mint laptop]                         
>>    make ARCHER               [Cray XE-6]                                 
>>    make BLUECRYSTAL          [U of Bristol HPC]                          

C. To Compile on a new platform:  Edit the variables in the file            
./makefiles/Makefile.YOUR_NEW_PLATFORM.in to match your system config. Then:
>>   make YOUR_NEW_PLATFORM                                                 
Once you are sure the code compiles and runs correctly, send me your Makefile.in
so I can include it in the next release at J.Finn@liv.ac.uk
